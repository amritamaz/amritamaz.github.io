    type: conference
    summary: The AMRI team at NVIDIA Research presents novel immersive 3D experiences at GTC 2025 that allows users to move around in a streaming video, in 3D, in real-time. This allows for a highly immersive video viewing experience, especially when paired with 3D displays such as the Looking Glass Go or virtual/mixed reality headsets.
